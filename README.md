Biocatch cold start problem. 

Problem :

Some of the financial instituate uses biometric data to enhance their security to authetnicate user. However, the data is kept centrally by a particular vendor/company e.g Bank and it takes a reasonable time to capture required biometric data to be useful (cold start issue). If a user go to another instituation, the biometric data is required to be collect from scatch.

Solution :

Create a set of unique and biocatch data that store in the etherthum and the user can provide the biocatch data to any instituate to enhance their security service without waiting biocatch data to be collected. It enhances to portability of the biocatch data and use has full control of their data and whom to share to. 

Biocatch data include :
Name
